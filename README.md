## Computational Practice: Learning Python with Software Carpentry: Setup.

## Background
The Python programming language provides access to powerful libraries filled with useful functions for data processing.  On Palmetto2, you can use Jupyter Notebooks and the Linux Operating (OS) to run Python or other code. 

In this Learning Path you will navigate the open-source Software Carpentry course on Python.  To get started, you will need to download two datasets into a working directory on Palmetto2 which is the subject of this lab.

Then you will be able to follow the Software Carpentry content by opening a Python Jupyter Notebook from the Launcher to the left. You can always use the drop down menu to start a new Launcher or simply open a new Jupyter Notebook.

## Step A Make a working directory on Palmetto2
- Start a JupyterLab node on Palmetto2.
- Open a terminal and create a working directory called 'swc-python'.
- Navigate to the working directory in the by clicking to the directory using the File Explorer on the left.

## Step B. Download and uncompress two datasets in the working directory using these commands:
Download and uncompress the datasets using these comamnds:

```
wget https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/files/code/python-novice-inflammation-code.zip
wget https://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/data/python-novice-inflammation-data.zip

unzip python-novice-inflammation-data.zip
unzip python-novice-inflammation-code.zip
```
You should see two folders called data and code in the swc-python directory.  

You now have the datasets need for subsequent Python lessons.  These lessons require that you start a Jupyter notebook from the Launcher to the left.

## Step C. Start a new Jupyter Notebook
Using the Launcher to a new notebook from the drop down menu. name it something intuitive. Make sure it is in your working directory. You will enter Python code in the Notebook. You can always rename, copy, and move the JupyterNotebook as it is just a file.

Good luck!
